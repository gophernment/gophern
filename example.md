### Go & htmx Markdown Presentation Engine

# Core Philosophy

Gophern is built to be a simple, lightweight, and modern presentation tool.

- **Developer First**: Write your slides in simple Markdown.
- **Aspect Ratio Lock**: Strictly maintains a professional 16:9 ratio.
- **Ultra Portable**: Serves local presentations via a Go binary, or exports everything into a single offline HTML file.
- **Real-Time Sync**: Synchronizes main view and presenter console using Server-Sent Events (SSE).

<!-- 
Explain why Gophern is a great alternative to heavy JS frameworks like Slidev or Marp when you want lightweight Go-based servers.

# How It Works

## Slide Parsing
Slides are separated by `---` lines.
Each slide can contain custom local frontmatter (YAML) to override colors, layouts, and backgrounds.

## Code Highlighting
Fenced code blocks are compiled server-side and styled using Chroma syntax highlighting.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Gophern!")
}
```

<!-- 
Highlight the use of Goldmark and Chroma on the server side for maximum parsing speed and safety.

# Presenter Dashboard

Run `gophern serve` and navigate to `/presenter` to open the presenter console.

- **Split Screen Previews**: Displays scaled-down previews of the current and next slides.
- **Clock & Timer**: Tracks your elapsed presentation time.
- **Speaker Notes**: Automatically extracts and displays HTML comments at the bottom of slides.
- **Sync Control**: Actions on either the presentation view or presenter console sync instantly via SSE.

<!-- 
Explain how HTMX's SSE extension connects to the server-sent event stream to update the preview screens instantly.

# CLI Interface

Manage your slide decks directly from the command line.

### Start the Live Server
```bash
gophern serve [-port 8080] example.md
```

### Export for Offline Sharing
```bash
gophern export [-o output.html] example.md
```

<!-- 
Explain the two subcommands: serve starts http.ListenAndServe; export bundles all assets into a single static file.

# Split Layouts: split-h

::left::
Use `::left::` and `::right::` markers to divide a slide into two
independently-authored regions. Set `ratio: "60/40"` to control the split.

::right::
```go
// Right region can hold its own
// code block, list, or any markdown.
func main() {
    fmt.Println("gophern")
}
```

layout: "split-v"
ratio: "50/50"

# Split Layouts: split-v

::top::
Top region — stacked vertically with `::top::` / `::bottom::`.

::bottom::
Bottom region. `layout: "split-v"` splits by row instead of by column.

ratio: "33/34/33"

# Split Layouts: split-3

::left::
Left third.

::center::
Center third.

::right::
Right third.

# Split Layouts: grid-4

::tl::
Top-left

Top-right

::bl::
Bottom-left

::br::
Bottom-right
